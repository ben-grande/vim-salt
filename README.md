# vim-salt

Salt plugin for Vim.

This plugin is a compilation of various Salt plugins with the files that I
found to work best, as the repositories I found them were archived and/or
incomplete. The files were not created by me, the copyright owners and
the licenses are written in the header of each file.

I do not plan to support further improvements.

This plugin requires [vim-jinja](https://github.com/ben-grande/vim-jinja)
plugin.
